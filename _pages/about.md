I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as an Economic Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

My primary research interests are econometrics and causal inference. I also have secondary interests in applied microeconomics.
